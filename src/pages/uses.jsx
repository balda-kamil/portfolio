            <Tool title="13.3” MacBook Pro i5 2,3GHz 16GB RAM, 256GB (2018) 💻">
              This laptop has everything that I want. Long battery life, high
              performance. It is incredibly slim and light as a feather. Always
              ready to work. This is my first MacBook but for sure not last one.

            <Tool title="LG 34UM88C-P 🖥">
              Ultra-wide 34` LG monitor, 3440 x 1440 (UWQHD), LED/IPS. For me,
              one big monitor is better than two smaller ones.

            <Tool title="Logitech MX Mechanical Mini ⌨">
              Logitech making the best keyboards on the market. This mechanical
              keyboard is very comfortable and compact. It allows you to connect
              up to 3 devices, in my job it is very important because currently
              I have 3 machines, all with different OS (Mac, Linux and Windows).
            </Tool>
            <Tool title="Logitech MX Master 2S 🖱">
              Very good and comfortable mouse, also it allows to connect up to 3

            <Tool title="Desk with height regulation ⚙️">
              It is very important to stand up while coding. Now I can`t imagine
              working for 12 hours and just sitting as I did before. In the past
              my legs were alwayes tired and sore.{' '}

              I don`t care if it`s missing all of the fancy IDE features
              everyone else relies on, VSC is still the best text editor ever
              made. I have a lot of extensions and I found my best theme ever,
              now my eyes are less tired.
            </Tool>
            <Tool title="iTerm2">
              I`m honestly not even sure what features I get with this that
              aren`t just part of the macOS Terminal 😅, but they have lovely
              skins.
